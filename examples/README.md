# Virtual Background Demo

## Setup

Run `npm install` from the `examples` folder. It will install the dependencies and run the application server.

## App (Chrome Only)

Open http://localhost:3000 in a Chrome tab. The app captures your camera upon loading and plays it in a `<video>` element. You can choose to enable, disable or update the background settings using the controls on the page.
